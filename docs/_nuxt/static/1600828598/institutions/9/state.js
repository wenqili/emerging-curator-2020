The biggest challenge so far seems to be explaining its obscure theoretical foundation clearly within 1-2 sentences. On one hand, research-oriented works, coupled with the abstract perspective of media and design theory, makes a friendly and approachable expression especially difficult. Although contemporary art has already become diversified, storytelling is still at the core. We are discussing the possibility of collaboration with a mentor from NEW INC who has a writing and strategy background. She will provide guidance to Zhenzheng and I. Togethr we will present the project in a suitable manner.",ideal:"Ideal institutions seem to imply that there are undesirable institutions. It may be that I myself do not have any special interest in the discussion of the subject of \"institution\", so I do not have any particularly critical views on the \"management\" of NEW INC. Just like ITP, I have always paid close attention to why ITP and NEW INC \"works.\" I think both NEW INC and ITP are very \"successful\" organizations. (NEW INC is a bit like a doctoral station of POST ITP to a certain extent) I don't know what the standard of \"institution\" is. In an everyday context, institutions seem to have countless relationships with authority. Both NEW INC and ITP focus on building a community. In addition to basic literacy, this community does not impose too many restrictions-the classic incubator model, incubating \"chaos\". The chaos gives birth to possibility, and both ITP and NEW INC have done this. To incubate chaos, there are two extremely important points. One is to build a non-critical environment. It is the premise of chaos that can encourage but not criticize, and praise but not criticize; the other is inclusiveness, although their admission is not accepted by all. , But they all try their best to be inclusive. Their annual admission of close to 3 digits is an attempt by them to counter prestigiousness. Moreover, if you cannot be a full member, then you can participate in other ways, and you can get the most valuable thing of this \"organization\", which is his Community. But having said that, they couldn't do no vetting at all, but they tried their best to move the adjusting lever to open between prestigious and open for all. NEW INC has no roles such as creative director or chief curator. Staff only has director of community, director, and head of program. The role is more like a server, which is very similar to itp. It is probably not a coincidence that the two institutions that came to New York experienced this pattern.

The organizer invited some scientific institutions, and the artists presented their plans, and then the scientific institutions wrote down the three most interested artists for blind dates. Then the two parties wrote three beloved guests on a small note and handed them to the organizer. After a while, I was notified that the pairing was successful, which should mean that this group of artists and scientists voted for each other. Let’s work out a joint plan to see what kind of project we are going to do. This process is basically what I am trying to do. I first understand their technology and equipment, and then propose a few plans, discuss with them one by one, and finally I write the project plan and submit it to the organizer. This time the plan was passed again, probably into the top ten, and then went to the Netherlands for an interview for evaluation. Finally, three groups of winners were selected. . The main content of this project is that I designed a special bedroom, where I stayed for a month without going out, trying to stay in bed. The team of scientists helped me detect physical changes in my body. The most important tasks are of course the proposal, the design of the project, and the planning process. These matters of doing the project itself will not be repeated. Let's talk about the cooperation affairs, mainly to connect with the gallery (the place where the final project is placed) and connect with the scientific team. Gallery: They will recommend me to design the space and installations where I live, and then start to purchase materials; contact the gallery to help see the location of the local venue, and they help me communicate with the locals about the cost and conditions of my rental. , I calculated the list of construction materials with the gallery, and the gallery dispatched a construction team to help me build. In this project, the construction team did not complete the construction in the expected time, and it has reached the date when I live alone by myself, so after I live, I completed the rest of the construction from painting, which I feel has become a normal project It's all artists who face all kinds of cooperation and coordination. Therefore, the important task is coordination. In addition to constantly honing the skills of coordination, it also requires participation in exhibitions after having a lot of skills. This is a process that everyone is more familiar with. In addition, they are usually in unfamiliar locations or even unfamiliar languages, such as things made in the Netherlands. I don’t speak Dutch. I have a lot of things I can’t do and communicate by myself. I have a certain sense of being out of control. I need to take uncertain factors into consideration in advance. . Science team: I do my homework in advance and find them to understand their technology and equipment. During this period, I also build up feelings and trust. I am a guinea pig in this project, so I myself have undergone a series of physical examinations, using their very advanced equipment. Because of the need to record, I also need to find a photographer to take pictures of the process of my inspection. Someone in their scientific team has experience in holding a camera, so this job is left to him. I'm a little frightened, and I'm afraid to cause trouble to others and be hated by others, so I don't dare to ask too much. Therefore, the quality of the film is not very professional. This is a problem I often encounter when doing projects. It is more obvious in repetition, because I dare not deal with people, and I often regret. The solution is to try to do projects that do not require others. But it actually requires a lot of social interaction. Fortunately, as an artist’s party, a little bit of incompatibility may still be tolerated. It should be [SymbioticA] that this replacement does not need to have a very specific implantation project. They hope that artists who study biology can use this as a starting point for entering the field of biological cooperation. My main purpose is to find opportunities to get into various laboratories and chat hard with scientists to see if I can do some experiments, learn some techniques, and find some inspiration. This substitution is my first time to participate in a biological laboratory. My self-recognition is to learn. As a young Asian, I have a sense of role. Faced with unfamiliar subjects, I can ask questions like a freshman. As a foreigner, I also have the right to be ignorant. When doing interdisciplinary projects, I feel that I often need to switch between the identities of \"technical ignorant\" and \"art professional\", and I need to find a self-consistent, comfortable and respectful model to deal with technical personnel. At that time, I still felt that “artists are not as good as scientists, scientists are great, understand how much, and transcend contribution and value”. Later, when the BAD project came to the BAD project, the cognition of “balance between the two sides” was gradually established.",disciplines:"Bio science",stack:"BAD is some equipment and technology to study metabolism, SymbioticA I have learned genetic modification, cell cultivation and other technologies; the small project I provide is to use the technology of condensing and extracting essential oils to refine the taste of people (clothes).",ref:af,criteria:"Internal to the panel",materials:aa,duration:B,support:"Funding, PR (referring to curators, institutions, media resources)",exhibitions:b,thoughs:"Mainly about the collaborative experience.

What they do is simply put forward some requests to the scientists\u002Fengineers and in return they provide the artist the techonology required. The artist remains the core body of the project whereas the scientist's participation is almost negelctable. I personally don't enjoy such collaboration - it makes me feel very arrogant and ashamed of myself. I hope the scientist in such projects can obtain as much satisfaction and reward as the artist. Therefore when I was at SymbioticA, I did some interviews with the participating scientists, asking what they think about art, interdisciplinary collaboration, and their own ambitions and accomplishment.

The bed is the most natural location for a directionless behavioral pause, as it is the place in the house most associated with inactivity and rest. But for the infirm and the elderly, bed(room)s are the world. For them, the bed is a symbol of limited bodily capability and physical dependency. And the long time spent lying down often gets the bedridden bad blood circulation, loss of muscle mass and social isolation. Being a paradox of health, the bed is a site of both recovery and deterioration.\nBut today, lying down is also a choice made by the able-bodied. Post-industrialization brought work back into the home and live a functional life without leaving the bedroom. The Internet generation can not only work in bed but eat, read, exercise, socialize in bed, even entertain sexual relationships with people miles away.
