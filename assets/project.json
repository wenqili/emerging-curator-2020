Recent 10 years has made them accustomed to the recommendation system - the screen tells them everything, but they are not willing to become a bio battery. They can't remember why they are stuck here. They don’t remember where they come from. The voice in their ear keeps telling them to go forward, next, next, next is good, next will be fantastic, the next one is the end. They feel familiar with at the moment, \"X is epoch-making\", \"Y is the change of human destiny\", \"Z era has arrived\", and later they have learnt that the letter after Z is AA.\n \nThe small car trained by neural networks can navigate efficiently in the maze, both it and Mario's goal are always forward, forward, and forward. The LED screen displays a new labyrinth each time the car reaches the other end of the maze, and the car will hit the road again and again. Yes, there will always be a princess in the next castle.\nIt should be appreciated that AI can help solve the problem, but they should not forget the origin of the problem. The spectators watched the car running in the maze, and they didn't ask why. The car is trained to move in the maze generated by the program. The car solves only one problem that is not present in another program, and produces a seemingly busy but empty cycle.\n \nThis project is made possible by the support of Maker Onsite.",

Prof. Vera Schrauwen of the Department of Nutrition and Movement Sciences at Maastricht University\nBAD Award 2018 Winner Project  |  Sponsored by ZonMw  |  Facilitate by MU ArtSpace\n \n \nIt is said we spend about a third of our lives lying down. The bed is the most natural location for a directionless behavioral pause, as it is the place in the house most associated with inactivity and rest. But for the infirm and the elderly, bed(room)s are the world. For them, the bed is a symbol of limited bodily capability and physical dependency. And the long time spent lying down often gets the bedridden bad blood circulation, loss of muscle mass and social isolation. Being a paradox of health, the bed is a site of both recovery and deterioration.\nBut today, lying down is also a choice made by the able-bodied. Post-industrialization brought work back into the home and live a functional life without leaving the bedroom. The Internet generation can not only work in bed but eat, read, exercise, socialize in bed, even entertain sexual relationships with people miles away. People have lived vertically for a long time, but maybe the horizontal posture will become popular in the 21st century?",

The plants keep growing and affecting the sound during the exhibition period, just like a gradually evolving instrument playing an composition from the preprogrammed light pattern, giving the viewer a unique listening experience with both audible and visible feedbacks.",
